## Notes:

It took more than 90 minutes, I had to switch back and forth since I'm busy with other things with the current company.

To do:

- refactor (some types need to be split into separate files, some constants has been left into components and the styles could be split into separate files)
- better responsive layout (at the moment I'm using a table which isn't suitable for responsive layouts)
- better layout design and theme I'm using base MUI elements without customization or theme
- table pagination (probably using the dataGrid component from MUI)
